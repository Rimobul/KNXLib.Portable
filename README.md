# KNXLib.Portable

This project is an attempt to make the KNX library from ligeemotions (https://github.com/lifeemotions/knx.net) available also in portable class libraries (PCLs). So far, only Windows 10 Universal Application is supported, but there are plans for supporting also other PCLs.

For licencing, please reffer to the original library.
